redmine hide menus
==================

This is a simple plugin showing how to hide menus in redmine

there is no config (yet), open init.rd and comment/uncomment menus you want to
hide/show.

If you need to hide more stuff, look there to have names of what you can hide.

yeah this is so simple it hardly justify a repo, but i'd rather not reinvent
the wheels, even small ones. :)
